# Amazon-Review-Rating-Prediction-with-NLP


The purpose of this analysis is to make up a prediction model where we will be able to predict whether a recommendation is positive or negative. In this analysis, we will not focus on the Score, but only the positive/negative sentiment of the recommendation.

To do so, we will work on Amazon's review dataset, we will build a Term-doc incidence matrix using term frequency and inverse document frequency ponderation. When the data is ready, we will load it into predicitve algorithms. In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the correct reviews.
